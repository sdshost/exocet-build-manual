        <li>Note, if you want to change gauge faces etc do this now.</li>
        <li>Cut off the white mounting tabs to allow the cluster to fit inside the gauge pod.</li>
        <li>Remove the front of the dash cluster (10 plastic clips around the edge). Store carefully as to not get damaged/dirty.</li>
        <li>When adhesive dry clip the dash back inplace. Note it will be very difficult to remove again.</li>
        <li>Using PU adhesive glue the the front of the cluster in place, ensure square and central.</li>
  	<li>Add some sticky back foam to the top of the ignition barrel mount plate for the front of the dash.</li>
        <li>Sit the dash in place, add masking tape to the chassis rail and the back of the gauge pod, drop lines to enable easy lining up again.</li>
        <li>Cut a piece of 3x30mm steel to aprx 370mm.</li>
        <li>Bend the ends up aprx 30 degrees at 70mm from each end, this piece should then fit in the back of the gauge pod, tweak angles as required.</li>
        <li>Mark equal distances in from lower rear edge of pod eg 20mm in, 15mm up.</li>
        <li>Drill with a stepper drill to 6mm.</li>
        <li>Fit the steel back in place, mark the holes, indicate which side is which, remove and drill 6mm holes.</li>
        <li>Cut 2 70mm pieces of the same material.</li>
        <li>Bend this back on itself to have a internal angle of aprx 70degrees.</li>
        <li>Fit the dash in place by your lines earlier, attach the steel to the pod (behind the steering bracket)</li>
        <li>Offer the 2 small pieces between the steering bracket and the pod bracket, tweak bends as required, mark position.</li>
        <li>Remove bracket, and weld together on the marks (drill and bolt if you prefer not to weld)</li>
        <li>Refit bracket, G clamp in place, fit guage pod + adjust as required.</li>
        <li>Remove guage pod leaving bracket</li>
        <li>Drill for 2 M8 Bolts and nuts.</li>
        <li>Paint and reassemble. Remember to connect speedo cable and wiring.</li>
